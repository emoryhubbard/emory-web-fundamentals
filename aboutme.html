      <h2>Emory Hubbard</h2>
      <p>I'm currently majoring in web design and development with the goal to become a web developer and software developer. </p>
      <p>I'm minoring in Illustration to get a great foundation in design and drawing to learn how to make good design, layouts, and assets for websites, apps, and/or games that I will develop. I'm learning to have a passion for art now that I've begun taking classes in it. Thanks to some tender mercies from Heavenly Father a former weak point is on its way to becoming a strength. My wife Amanda is an amazing illustrator and she has been helping me and inpsiring me a lot in this field. I chose one of her illustrations of us for this page.</p>
      <p>I love reading, programming, and going on dates with my wife. I spend a lot of time at work as a delivery driver and I'm a full-time student as well, but when I do have some free time you will find me spending time with family. I hope to read the third volume of Saints soon.</p>
      <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 4 years. I served a mission for 2 of those. The Savior found me while I was praying and searching for what God's plan for my life was. I got a phone call from two Sister missionaries who helped me discover that the Lord has called prophets again, brought forth wonderful Scripture, and restored His Church. By the power of the Holy Ghost I came to know the truth of the Book of Mormon.</p>
